# kimonolabs
This python script will attempt to retrieve data from both current and previous versions of an API built using [kimonolabs](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) API generator and save files in JSON format.  To use the script, simply edit the *api_id* and *api_key* values with your own in the **kimonoconfig.py.sample** file and save as **kimonoconfig.py**.  After editing the config file, simply run `$ python kimonolabs.py` to fetch and save your data.

First the script will determine the current version and if the file doesn't already exist, the script will create it.  From there, the script simply goes back one version at a time, making sure it doesn't overwrite an existing file, until all available versions have been saved.
